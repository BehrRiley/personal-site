# personal-site
My site consisting of my portfolio, blogs, and everything else of mine for sharing.

This repository is explicitly for creating my site via html, css, and javascript before migrating to my DenizenScript webserver engine.

Feedback, criticism, and questions are always welcome - you may create an issue or a pull request, email me if you can find my email, or message me directly for the fastest responses on Discord `@Hydra Melody#0001`
